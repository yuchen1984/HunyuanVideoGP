## Features
*GPU Poor version by **DeepBeepMeep**. This great video generator can now run smoothly on a 12 GB to 24 GB GPU.*

This version has the following improvements over the original Hunyuan Video model:
- Reduce greatly the RAM requirements and VRAM requirements
- Much faster thanks to compilation and fast loading / unloading
- 5 profiles in order to able to run the model at a decent speed on a low end consumer config (32 GB of RAM and 12 VRAM) and to run it at a very good speed on a high end consumer config (48 GB of RAM and 24 GB of VRAM)
- Autodownloading of the needed model files
- Improved gradio interface with progression bar and more options
- Multiples prompts / multiple generations per prompt
- Support multiple pretrained Loras with 32 GB of RAM or less
- Switch easily between Hunyuan and Fast Hunyuan models and quantized / non quantized models
- Much simpler installation



This fork by DeepBeepMeep is an integration of the mmpg module on the gradio_server.py.

It is an illustration on how one can set up on an existing model some fast and properly working CPU offloading with changing only a few lines of code in the core model.

For more information on how to use the mmpg module, please go to: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/mmgp

You will find the original Hunyuan Video repository here: https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo
 


## Installation Guide for Linux and Windows

We provide an `environment.yml` file for setting up a Conda environment.
Conda's installation instructions are available [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html).

We recommend CUDA versions 12.4 or 11.8 for the manual installation.

```shell
# 1. Prepare conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate HunyuanVideo

# 3. Install pip dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt


# 4.1 optional Flash attention support (easy to install on Linux but much harder on Windows)
python -m pip install flash-attn==2.7.2.post1

# 4.2 optional Sage attention support (30% faster, easy to install on Linux but much harder on Windows)
python -m pip install sageattention==1.0.6 

# 4.3 optional Xformers attention support (same speed as sdpa attention but lower VRAM requirements, easy to install on Linux but much harder on Windows)
python -m pip install xformers

```

Note that *Flash attention* and *Sage attention* are quite complex to install on Windows but offers a better memory management (and consequently longer videos) than the default *sdpa attention*.
Likewise *Pytorch Compilation* will work on Windows only if you manage to install Triton. It is quite a complex process I will try to provide a script in the future.

## Run the application

### Run a Gradio Server on port 7860 (recommended)
```bash
python gradio_server.py
```

Every lora stored in the subfoler 'loras' will be automatically loaded. You will be then able to activate / desactive any of them when running the application

You can also pre activate some loras and specify their corresponding multipliers when loading the app:
```bash
python gradio_server.py --lora-weight lora.safetensors --lora-multiplier 1
```


You can find prebuilt Loras on https://civitai.com/ or build them with tools such kohya or onetrainer.

### Give me Speed !
If you are a speed addict and are ready to accept some tradeoff on the quality I have added two switches:
- Fast Hunyuan Video enabled by default + Sage Attention + Teacache (an advanced acceleration algorithm x2 the speed for a small quality cost)
```bash
python gradio_server.py --fast
```

- Fast Hunyuan Video enabled by default + Sage Attention + Teacache (an advanced acceleration algorithm x2 the speed for a small quality cost) + Compilation  
```bash
python gradio_server.py --fastest
```
Please note that the first sampling step of the first video generation will talke two minutes to perform the compilation. Consecutive generations will be very fast unless you trigger a new compilation by changing the resolution, duration of the video or add / remove loras.

For these two switches to work you will need to install Triton and Sage attention.

As you can change the prompt without causing a recompilation, theses switches work quite well with th *Multiple prompts* and / or *Multiple Generations* options.

With the *--fastest* switch activated **a 1280x720 97 frames video takes with a Lora takes less than 4 minutes to be generated** !


### Command line parameters for Gradio Server
--profile no : default (4) : no of profile between 1 and 5\
--quantize-transformer bool: (default True) : enable / disable on the fly transformer quantization\
--lora-dir path : Path of directory that contains Loras in diffusers / safetensor format\
--lora-weight path1 path2 ... : list of Loras Path preselected Loras\
--lora-multiplier float mult1 mult2 ... : list of relative weights for each preselected Lora. The corresponding Lora file must be in the diffusers format.\
--verbose level : default (1) : level of information between 0 and 2\
--server-port portno : default (7860) : Gradio port no\
--server-name name : default (0.0.0.0) : Gradio server name\
--open-browser : open automatically Browser when launching Gradio Server\

--compile : turn on pytorch compilation
--fastest : shortcut for --fast + --compile
--attention mode: force attention mode among, sdpa, flash, sage and xformers

### Profiles (for power users only)
You can choose between 5 profiles, these will try to leverage the most your hardware, but have little impact for HunyuanVideo GP:
- HighRAM_HighVRAM  (1):  the fastest well suited for a RTX 3090 / RTX 4090 but consumes much more VRAM, adapted for fast shorter video
- HighRAM_LowVRAM  (2): a bit slower, better suited for RTX 3070/3080/4070/4080 or for RTX 3090 / RTX 4090 with large pictures batches or long videos
- LowRAM_HighVRAM  (3): adapted for RTX 3090 / RTX 4090 with limited RAM  but at the cost of VRAM (shorter videos)
- LowRAM_LowVRAM  (4): if you have little VRAM or want to generate longer videos 
- VerylowRAM_LowVRAM  (5): at least 24 GB of RAM and 10 GB of VRAM : if you don't have much it won't be fast but maybe it will work

Profile 2 (High RAM) and 4 (Low RAM)are the most recommended profiles since they are versatile (support for long videos for a slight performance cost).\
However, a safe approach is to start from profile 5 (default profile) and then go down progressively to profile 4 and then to profile 2 as long as the app remains responsive or doesn't trigger any out of memory error.

### Other Models for the GPU Poor
- Hunyuan3D-2GP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Hunyuan3D-2GP :\
A great image to 3D and text to 3D tool by the Tencent team. Thanks to mmgp it can run with less than 6 GB of VRAM

- FluxFillGP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/FluxFillGP :\
One of the best inpainting / outpainting tools based on Flux that can run with less than 12 GB of VRAM.

- Cosmos1GP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Cosmos1GP :\
This application include two models: a text to world generator and a image / video to world (probably the best open source image to video generator).

- OminiControlGP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/OminiControlGP :\
A Flux derived application very powerful that can be used to transfer an object of your choice in a prompted scene. With mmgp you can run it with only 6 GB of VRAM.

### Run through the command line
```bash
cd HunyuanVideo

python sample_video.py \
    --video-size 720 1280 \

## **Abstract**
We present HunyuanVideo, a novel open-source video foundation model that exhibits performance in video generation that is comparable to, if not superior to, leading closed-source models. In order to train HunyuanVideo model, we adopt several key technologies for model learning, including data curation, image-video joint model training, and an efficient infrastructure designed to facilitate large-scale model training and inference. Additionally, through an effective strategy for scaling model architecture and dataset, we successfully trained a video generative model with over 13 billion parameters, making it the largest among all open-source models. 

We conducted extensive experiments and implemented a series of targeted designs to ensure high visual quality, motion diversity, text-video alignment, and generation stability. According to professional human evaluation results, HunyuanVideo outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including Runway Gen-3, Luma 1.6, and 3 top-performing Chinese video generative models. By releasing the code and weights of the foundation model and its applications, we aim to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source video foundation models. This initiative will empower everyone in the community to experiment with their ideas, fostering a more dynamic and vibrant video generation ecosystem.
